TLM is a modeling abstraction used in hardware verification to model communication between different components at a higher level of abstraction than traditional RTL (Register Transfer Level) modeling.


## TLM Analysis FIFO

### Summary
The `uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo` class is part of the TLM utilities in UVM and is used to implement a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer for communication between producers and consumers of transactions. It is commonly employed in scenarios where one part of the testbench generates transactions (the producer), and another part consumes these transactions (the consumer) for analysis or further processing.

In UVM (Universal Verification Methodology), the `uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo` is a class provided by the UVM library that is specifically designed for transaction-level modeling (TLM) analysis in a testbench environment. TLM is a modeling abstraction used in hardware verification to model communication between different components at a higher level of abstraction than traditional RTL (Register Transfer Level) modeling.

The `uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo` class is part of the TLM utilities in UVM and is used to implement a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer for communication between producers and consumers of transactions. It is commonly employed in scenarios where one part of the testbench generates transactions (the producer), and another part consumes these transactions (the consumer) for analysis or further processing.

Here are some key points about `uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo`:

1. **FIFO Buffer:**
    - The class implements a FIFO data structure, meaning that the order in which transactions are added to the FIFO is maintained when they are retrieved.
2. **Thread-Safe:**
    - The FIFO is designed to be thread-safe, making it suitable for use in a multi-threaded simulation environment where multiple processes may be accessing the FIFO concurrently.
    - FIFO is implemented using Mailbox object internally, rather than a raw queue. Because Mailboxes preserves thread safety.
1. **Blocking and Non-Blocking Operations:**
    - The FIFO supports both blocking and non-blocking read and write operations. Blocking operations can be used when waiting for space in the FIFO or when waiting for a transaction to be available for processing.
2. **Configurability:**
    - The size of the FIFO (number of entries) is configurable to accommodate different use cases and resource constraints.
3. **Transaction Payload:**
    - Transactions placed into the FIFO are typically TLM transactions, which are higher-level representations of activity in the design compared to traditional RTL signals.
